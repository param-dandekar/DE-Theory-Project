## Emulation of a rudimentary 8-bit microprocessor (PS-1021)

This project aims to design and emulate the working of a rudimentary 8-bit processor, with a primary focus on understanding and implementing digital logic principles and a secondary focus on assembly language programming. The architecture of the processors is based on classic 8-bit CPUs such as the Intel 8085, with a limited instruction set and a basic ALU.
